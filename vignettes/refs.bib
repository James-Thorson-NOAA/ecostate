	abstract = {Ecosystem models are important tools for conducting ecosystem-based management. A particularly useful method of characterizing the flow of energy through an ecosystem and the subsequent direct and indirect implications of management actions is mass balance modeling. Here we outline the equations as utilized in Rpath, an R implementation of the mass balance algorithms popularized by Ecopath with Ecosim that are designed to work with fisheries data sources. We believe that common practices in R will aid in the reproducibility of conducting analysis using a mass balance model as all of the code is contained within a single script file. This includes the built-in statistical and graphical functions of R. In addition to added reproducibility, R is a coding language with which ecologists are familiar. This familiarity offers greater flexibility for practitioners to tailor the model to their needs. We have made the code available on an open software development platform which should aid in continuous community development of the tool.},

	abstract = {A simple model termed ECOPATH is presented which estimates mean annual biomass, production, and consumption for components of an ecosystem. To use the model, the ecosystem must be partitioned into groups of similar species and provide for these species groups, estimates of production to biomass, diet, and food consumption. The ECOPATH model is applied to an ecosystem at French Frigate Shoals in the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. Extensive field work provides both estimates of the input parameters as well as estimates of mean annual biomass and production. Biomass and production estimates for some of the species groups modeled are used to validate the estimates generated by the model.},

	abstract = {The linear equations that describe trophic fluxes in mass-balance, equilibrium assessments of ecosystems (such as in the ECOPATH approach) can be re-expressed as differential equations defining trophic interactions as dynamic relationships varying with biomasses and harvest regimes. Time patterns of biomass predicted by these differential equations, and equilibrium system responses under different exploitation regimes, are found by setting the differential equations equal to zero and solving for biomasses at different levels of fishing mortality. Incorporation of our approach as the ECOSIM routine into the well-documented ECOPATH software will enable a wide range of potential users to conduct fisheries policy analyses that explicitly account for ecosystem trophic interactions, without requiring the users to engage in complex modelling or information gathering much beyond that required for ECOPATH. While the ECOSIM predictions can be expected to fail under fishing regimes very different from those leading to the ECOPATH input data, ECOSIM will at least indicate likely directions of biomass change in various trophic groups under incremental experimental policies aimed at improving overall ecosystem management. That is, ECOSIM can be a valuable tool for design of ecosystem-scale adaptive management experiments},

	abstract = {EcoSim II uses results from the Ecopath procedure for trophic mass-balance analysis to define biomass dynamics models for predicting temporal change in exploited ecosystems. Key populations can be represented in further detail by using delay-difference models to account for both biomass and numbers dynamics. A major problem revealed by linking the population and biomass dynamics models is in representation of population responses to changes in food supply; simple proportional growth and reproductive responses lead to unrealistic predictions of changes in mean body size with changes in fishing mortality. EcoSim II allows users to specify life history mechanisms to avoid such unrealistic predictions: animals may translate changes in feeding rate into changes in reproductive rather than growth rates, or they may translate changes in food availability into changes in foraging time that in turn affects predation risk. These options, along with model relationships for limits on prey availability caused by predation avoidance tactics, tend to cause strong compensatory responses in modeled populations. It is likely that such compensatory responses are responsible for our inability to find obvious correlations between interacting trophic components in fisheries time-series data. But Ecosim II does not just predict strong compensatory responses: it also suggests that large piscivores may be vulnerable to delayed recruitment collapses caused by increases in prey species that are in turn competitors/predators of juvenile piscivores.},

	abstract = {Age-structured stock assessment models are used worldwide to predict the likely impact of changing harvest on future fisheries yield. However, age-structured models ignore the impacts of predator consumption on prey survival (top-down impacts) and prey availability on predator growth (bottom-up impacts), whereas multispecies statistical catch-at-age models often incorporate top-down but not bottom-up impacts. Here, we address this gap by demonstrating a generic approach for including bottom-up interactions in an age-structured statistical model by linking individual growth to population-scale consumption. We specifically extend Ecostate, a recent model that adapts Ecopath/Ecosim dynamics to jointly estimate biological and fishery parameters as well as unexplained process errors. We first add age-structured dynamics for select species using stanzas, i.e., an age-range over which age-structured productivity and consumption match mass-balance constraints. We then incorporate likelihood components representing fit to age-composition and empirical weight-at-age data while also estimating residual variation in larval survival (recruitment deviations) and consumption (weight-at-age deviations). To demonstrate, we fit to abundance-index and age-composition data for two commercial species (Alaska pollock and sablefish) in the Gulf of Alaska, including mass-balance dynamics for its primary energetic supply, and not fitting weight-at-age data so that it can be used for out-of-sample evaluation of model performance. We show that the model can be viewed as a multispecies age-structured model (e.g., estimating adult mortality rates, survey catchability and selectivity, and biomass while tracking cohorts) and as a mass-balance ecosystem model (e.g., estimate trophic position and weight-at-age based on forage consumption). The predicted weight-at-age is weakly correlated with independent measurements for pollock and sablefish, but were improved when we incorporated forage biomass indices. We conclude that bottom-up interactions can be added to age-structured stock assessment models, and can address new questions regarding forage availability on weight-at-age for use in stock assessments.},
