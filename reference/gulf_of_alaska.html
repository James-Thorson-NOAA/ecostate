    <p>The data compiled come from a variety of sources:</p><ul><li><p>Sablefish biomass index and age-comps are from a cooperative longline survey, and
the index is treated as a relative index.</p></li>
<li><p>Pollock biomass index and age-comps are from a bottom trawl survey, and
the index is treated as a relative index with a prior on the catchability coefficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Copepod biomass is from an oblique tow bongo net survey,
with data provided by Dave Kimmel.</p></li>
<li><p>Euphausiid biomass is from the Seward Long-Term Ecological Research program,
provided by Russ Hopcroft to the Ecological Status Report.</p></li>
<li><p>Other P_over_B, Q_over_B and Diet_proportions values
are derived from Rpath models, provided by Bia Dias.</p></li>
<li><p>Age-structed inputs are determined based on life-history information and
biological samples.
